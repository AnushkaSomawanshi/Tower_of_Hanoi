# Tower_of_Hanoi
The Tower of Hanoi Project demonstrates recursion by solving the classic puzzle of moving disks between three rods while following the rules: only one disk can be moved at a time, and no larger disk can be placed on a smaller one. It visually illustrates each step, making it ideal for learning algorithmic problem-solving.

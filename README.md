# Tower_of_Hanoi
The Towers of Hanoi Visualizer is a web-based application that provides an interactive way to explore and understand the classic Towers of Hanoi puzzle. This project allows users to specify the number of disks (from 1 to 10), adjust the animation speed using a slider, and watch the puzzle being solved step-by-step through dynamic visualizations. The interface is responsive, making it suitable for both desktop and mobile browsers.

The application is built using modern web technologies, including HTML for structuring the page, CSS for styling and animations, and JavaScript to handle the logic for solving the puzzle and animating the disk movements. The recursive algorithm powering the solution is seamlessly integrated into the visualization, offering an educational and engaging experience.

To use the visualizer, simply open the index.html file in any browser. Enter the desired number of disks in the input field, click the "Start Game" button, and watch the solution unfold. The animation speed can be adjusted at any time using the slider control.

This project is structured with three main files: index.html for the layout, styles.css for the design, and script.js for the functionality. It is designed to provide an intuitive and visually appealing representation of the Towers of Hanoi puzzle, making it an excellent tool for both learning and demonstration.
